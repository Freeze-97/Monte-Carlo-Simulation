# Ⓜ️ Monte Carlo Simulation

This is a C++ project that performs simulations using Monte Carlo methods. The codebase is organized into multiple modules and supports restarting simulations from saved states.

## 🧪 Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)
- Make utility (for using the `Makefile`)

## 🛠️ Build Instructions

To compile the project, simply run:

```bash
make
```

This will produce an executable named output.

To clean up the compiled files:
```bash
make clean
```

## 🚀 Usage

After building, run the program with:
```bash
./output
```
